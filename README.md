# Project Proposal

## Project title
Diet Daze

## What and why?
This app helps people easily create weekly meal plans by using AI to generate recipes based on key ingredients. First, people will pick a a specific diet they want to start (bulking, losing weight, improving gut health, or just incorporating more vegetables into their diet). Each diet will have specific ingredients associated with it. Then the app will use an AI model to create daily recipes that use specified ingredients. Users can create their own profiles to keep track of their diets. There will be specific customizations available such as choosing the kind of meal (breakfast, lunch, dinner), how many days to create recipes for, cuisine type, allergies, and what ingredients to not include based on the user's preferences. 

As someone who meal plans each week, I would personally find a tool like this helpful because it saves me the time and energy to create recipes and choose ingredients I would like to buy. Additionally, not everyone is very knowledgable about the kinds of foods in each diet and having a tool randomly generate possible meals can give a user more variety to eat. 

## For whom?
I think this app targets people of all ages and groups, but the kinds of people who I want to specifically make this app for would be college students since many don't have time to try to meal plan on their own. I hope by introducing this app, this will encourage students to make more meals at home, save money from not eating out, and help them become healthier. 

## How?
Frontend: JavaScript, React
Backend: JavaScript, Express
Database: MongoDB
API: Chatgpt or another generative AI model

## Scope
I think this project can be done by 3-4 people this semester because there are a lot of aspects to consider when making this kind of app. There is a lot of user research needed to ensure that this app can fully meet user needs and solve most user pain points and having this many people can help bring different perspectives to it. Secondly, there will be dedicated time to train the AI model to suit the app's functions and allow for specific customizations for users. And lastly, I hope that we will spend a lot of time talking about the design choices for this app and make it appeal to many users and easy to use.
